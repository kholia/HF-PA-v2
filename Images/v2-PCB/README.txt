TIP: When doing a 'Zone Fills' ("ground copper pour"), increase the default
track clearance from 0.508 to 1.016. This helps a lot with homebrewing PCBs.

The "PCB v2" version uses this.

Note: (BS170) MOSFETs are easy to destroy via ESD! Using SIP sockets + a single
power supply source help in not destroying MOSFETs via ESD!

The "PCB v3" will use SIP sockets!

Use 0.8mm drill bit for making holes. Only the PCB Mount SMA connector requires
bigger drill holes.

Ignore the "common noise" superimposed on the output RF sine wave - we will
use better probing techniques in the future ;)
